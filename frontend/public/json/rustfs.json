  "description": "RustFS is a high-performance, distributed object storage system developed in Rust, leveraging the language's memory safety and performance. RustFS combines simplicity with efficiency, offering an open-source, free object storage solution suitable for private cloud deployments. It is fully compatible with the S3 protocol and released under the Apache 2.0 license. Built by a global community of engineers, RustFS serves as a commercially-friendly alternative to restrictive open-source storage products.",
