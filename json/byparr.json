    "description": "Byparr is a FlareSolverr drop-in replacement with FastAPI and nodriver. It allows applications like Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, and Readarr to access websites that are protected by Cloudflare and other anti-bot systems. Unlike the original FlareSolverr, Byparr uses a more lightweight approach for solving Cloudflare challenges without relying on Puppeteer or full browser automation.",
